        I am a software engineer currently part the foundation team at The Creative Assembly. In pursuit of knowledge, I constantly meddle in uncharted territories beyond my skill set. Some areas that I have dwelled in over the past couple of years include desktop application development, low level graphics APIs (i.e OpenGL & Vulkan), web development and much more!
        <br/><br/>
        This site aims to be a space where I showcase my projects and share my knowledge. Feel free to take a look around and enjoy your stay. Disclaimer, opinions expressed are solely my own.
